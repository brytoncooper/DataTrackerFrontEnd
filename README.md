## Development Environment

The software was developed using Angular, a platform for building mobile and desktop web applications, and TypeScript, a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript. The development process was supported by Angular CLI for project scaffolding and development tasks, and Visual Studio Code was used as the IDE.

**Tools & Technologies:**
- Angular CLI
- Visual Studio Code
- Git with GitHub for version control

**Programming Language and Libraries:**
- TypeScript
- Angular Router for managing navigation
- Bootstrap for styling and responsive design
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first CSS framework

# DataTracker

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.8.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
